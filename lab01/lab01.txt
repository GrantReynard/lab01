Q5: yes

Q6:yes 

Q7: I was not sucsessful in opening 

Q8: chmod 700 hello.bash or chmod 755 hello.bash (if thats what you mean heres another just in case chmod w hello.bash)

Q9: so opening in the vi editor I was able to make a change wivh leads me to beleave that I chmod'ed wrong. Because I should
not be able to write any thing here is my code:
gjr43@tux2:~/CS265/lab01$ chmod 400 funny
gjr43@tux2:~/CS265/lab01$ vi funny
gjr43@tux2:~/CS265/lab01$ vi funny
I sayed warning you are changing a read only file however it saved the changes 

Q10: This:
gjr43@tux2:~/public_html$ ls *
annoy     index.html  itemList-2cols  UnitTestingPhase
annoy.cc  itemList    TelecomTruths
gjr43@tux2:~/public_html$ ls a*
annoy  annoy.cc
gjr43@tux2:~/public_html$ ls *m*
index.html  itemList  itemList-2cols  TelecomTruths
gjr43@tux2:~/public_html$ ls anno?
annoy
gjr43@tux2:~/public_html$ ls annoy?
ls: cannot access 'annoy?': No such file or directory

Q11: First i wrote "2 files to edit" then it took me to edit a file names "a" but it only seemed to create "a"
gjr43@tux2:~/public_html$ vi a space
2 files to edit
gjr43@tux2:~/public_html$ ls
a      annoy.cc    itemList        TelecomTruths
annoy  index.html  itemList-2cols  UnitTestingPhase
gjr43@tux2:~/public_html$
